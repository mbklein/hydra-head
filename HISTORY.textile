* Fixed Solr 4 compatibility issue in construction of policy clauses in Hydra::PolicyAwareAccessControlsEnforcement.
* Removed references to dictionaries that are not in the default solrconfig.
* Config templates are now in active-fedora.
* hydra-access-controls requires blacklight.
* Upgrade guide removed -- see wiki for upgrade notes.
* Added .yardopts so that rdoc.info generates correct API documentation.
* active-fedora upgraded to 6.1.

h3. 6.0.0 (2013-03-28)
* Added a jetty generator
  If you want to install a version of jetty on your local machine to develop you project,
  you can now do: 'rails generate hydra:jetty'

* Using new solr schema
  The new solr schema is written to be a more efficient (smaller document size) and easier to configure
  in your OmDatastream or RDFDatastreams. 

  You need to put in place the new schema.xml and solrconfig.xml.  Then restart solr and reindex using:
  'ActiveFedora::Base.reindex_everything'

  You're going to want to search your project to make sure you don't have any fields coded like: *_t or *_s 
  These field names have changed to *_tesim and *_ssim respectively.  

  Finally change your config/initializer/hydra_config.rb to look something like this:
  https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/blob/master/hydra-core/lib/generators/hydra/templates/config/initializers/hydra_config.rb


  For more information about the new index see the Solrizer 3.0.0 docs:
  https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Solr-Schema
  https://github.com/projecthydra/solrizer/blob/master/README.textile


* Added a Hydra::Controllers::DownloadBehavior which allows you to easily create 
  a controller to serve the content of datastreams.  

  class DownloadsController < ApplicationController
    include Hydra::Controller::DownloadBehavior
  end

  then in config/routes.rb add ```resources :downloads```

  then you can do a GET /downloads/{pid}?datastream_id=thumbnail  to get the thumbnail datastream
  
  By default this allows any user with read access to the object identified by pid to download any
  of the datatreams.  If you want to control which datastreams a user has access to, overwrite the
  can_download? method.
  
  This example allows anyone to download a 'thumbnail' datastream:

  def can_download?
    datastream.dsid == 'thumbnail'
  end

h3. 5.1.0

h3. 5.0.0
* We no longer require the hydra-file-access stuff by default, add "gem 'hydra-file-access'" if you want to continue to use it.
* Upgrade to active-fedora 5.0 (you must add :index_as=>[:searchable] to models you want to index in solr)

h3. 4.1.1
* Fixed solr gated access query so that it doesn't keep appending 'registered' group
* Moved user into hydra-access-controls, bump hydra-access-controls to 0.0.5

h3. 4.1.0
* Add AccessControlsEnforcement to AssetsController
* Upgrade to active fedora ~>4.1
* Upgrade to solrizer-fedora 2.1.0
* Upgrade to blacklight ~> 3.4 
* Improved access controls api
* HYDRA-817 allow overriding of where we redirect_to, so that nested routes will work
* Extracted hydra-mods and hydra-access-controls
* Deprecation fest in preparation for 5.0
* HYDRA-822 Move GlobalConfig into Hydra. It was removed from Blacklight.
* HYDRA-831 apply_depositor_metadata should not overwrite existing user permissions
* HYDRA-832 depositor should apply depositor metadata if the properties datastream exists
* Fix up layout to better match blacklight.

Note about deprecations:  We encourage the implementer to create their own controllers
for CRUD operations and use standard Rails forms rather than using the AssetsController 
and the AssetsControllerHelpers. In the 5.0 series these capabilites will be removed from
HydraHead.  If you want to continue using these modules, you should copy the appropriate 
files from this release into your local Hydra application. Further simplified examples 
of this approach will be forthcoming. Until then, scholarsphere is a great exemplar.
